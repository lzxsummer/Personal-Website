									<h4>traveling ad.</h4>
									<h6>wallpaper</h6>
									<p>Designed for an advertisement of a travel agency, for a short-term journey which covered hot-spring and skiling and gambling.</p>
									
									<p>For attracting specific group of people who loves oriental cultures and arts, I used vertical fonts and brush fonts to produce an oriental style wallpaper. Considering the winter season, the whole color moves towards to a warm-winter feeling color, it's a remix of two low saturation colors: cold blue and warm orange.</p>

									<h6>book</h6>
									<p>Virtual,This is an wrapper of a imagined lifes-discussing book.</p>
									
									<p>I used a pure white background and a simplified composing to deliver a trustful and mature feeling to the reader. The picture, I made it to tell the reader---life is like a train, a train gets longer and longer by accumulating knowledges and memories and so much more. </p>
									
									<p>The composition below the title was made to look like a train as well, a train made up by words.</p>

									<p>The object group of people the magazine oriented are gamers and game enthusiasts. Orange is the theme color I used for representing the enthusiasm and interesting impression that games give us, but it was made deeper than ordinary orange to give an steady and hardcore impression.</p>

The color transfers from orange to dark blue on the background, gives the reader creative and trustful feelings. </p>

								<h4>Artworks and art news sharing website</h4>
								<h6>functional</h6>
								<p>Virtual,This is designed for a website which shares daily popular artworks from different fields such as illustration, photography, gaming, movies, blog.</p>
								
								<p>I used a composition of main part and side bar.On the side bar, the webpage will randomly show latiest dynamics.
								</p> 

								<p>The design of blocks derived from post cards, I want to give the whole website a friendly and delicated ui that users will have comfortable and familiar feelings when they're using it.
								</p> 

								<p>Due to the amount of distrincts and informations to be displayed, I centralized news blocks of different fields in a single div, then used a top right navigation to switch from this field to the other, which made it easy to browse that every field can be gathered in one place.</p>

								<h4>Theme oriented website</h4>
								<h6>functional</h6>
								<p>Virtual,This is designed to make a theme website. I didn't find the unique title of it that I used random images here just for presentation.</p>
								
								<p>Those numbers are not only used to connect different blocks of the whole webpage but also made to act as guiding figures to give users a vision journey.</p>

								<p>I've been working hard on the diversity of blocks. I used similar block designs on my first webpage, this time I wanted to break the frame and made something stay on one theme but look different and interesting. During this designing experience, I found theme colors with repeating elements are the most important things to make your website stay in one theme. If that is secured, we can make some audacious designs for blocks and compositions.</p>

								<h4>My illustrations</h4>
								<h6>Photoshop,easy paint tool Sai</h6>
								<p>I love japanese animations that the style of my artworks are mainly japanese characters. However, I'm willing to accept and learn more styles of painting.</p>
								
								<p>Mostly illustrations presenting are from 2014-2016. I didn't draw much after my graduation of university. I spent more time in focusing on my first job and learning graphic designs by myself since I haven't got trained of making professional designs.</p>

								<p>Everyone has their own favorite things about painting. For me, It's summer,skies,starlights. Summertime, I have passion in creating artworks with those elements included. In my opinion, they represent the goodness of lifes, they give us energy and hope and places we want to go to.</p>
